"""Hjemmel rule engine — declarative compliance rules backed by law citations.

Rules live in /rules as YAML files, one per legal article. Each rule carries
its source citation (lov, artikel, citat, url, sidst_verificeret), trigger
signals, predicates the assessor must answer, and a deterministic decision
expression that maps predicate answers to GO / BETINGET-GO / NO-GO.

LLM is allowed only in `signal_extractor` to interpret free-text input into
structured signals. The decision itself is always deterministic.
